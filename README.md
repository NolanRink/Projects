Coding project
How To Use
The program is very simple to use. Just open the project and run it.
Once itâ€™s running just use the command line to follow the prompts displayed in the terminal.

Special cases: 
1.  In the event everyone folds, the one remaining player should check until the winner prompt appears.
  The one remaining player should then be selected as the winner.
2.  Blinds are not automatically bet so make sure that the first two people to act are posting their blinds.
